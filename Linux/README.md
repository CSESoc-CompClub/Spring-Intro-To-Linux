    - Navigate into a secret directory called ‘vault’
   
Mission 1
- Good job for completing your first mission! 
- You walk into the vault for the next step. You are tasked to find specific files within the dark maze of cabinets. However, you are taken aback by the unkempt state of the room.

    - List all the files in the ‘vault‘ directory to find the secret files

Mission 4

Mission 5
- You've almost completed your training course! Woohoo! 
- But wait! Director Poco sees something in you. They are presenting you with a crazy opportunity. To immediately advance to Director of the CIA Shell Security Division, you have to present the *secret file* to them.
    - Using all the gathered information, use a command to locate the file in the vault!

Mission 6
- You're almost set up to become the new director! The very last thing that you need to do is to create a safe house, because every director needs a safe house!
    - Create a new directory named "safe_house" to keep your codes SAFE
    - Use mv to move the secret file from vault to safe_house
    - Go into the safe house and display the file to complete the course!


Bonus Mission
- Congrats on making it into the big leagues! As director, you can use your knowledge in any way you deem fit to ensure security in the penguin empire!
- Here are some ideas on things you can do now!
    - Use cp to create a duplicate of the secret file to send to another agency
    - Your new intern has gotten lost! Tell them to use pwd to find out where they are!
    - Create a profile with some information about yourself by using touch and echo
    - Move your profile out of your safe house to make it accessible to other agents.
    - Uh oh! It appears that the enemy has infiltrated the safe house. Delete all confidential files in the safe house with rm.
